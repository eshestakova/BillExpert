-- Excel file dosie.xls contains names, authors and result: has the law passed or not.

-- In jupyter notebook DocumentEnactmentPredictor.ipynb there is some data processing, some machine learning to predict result and some Telegram-API stuff to make a bot. Everyhing is done and explained step by step for your comfort :3

-- BillExpert.ipynb contains the same information, but it isn't separated. It's easier to compile, but more difficult to understand.

-- In .docx files Bill Expert (article) and Bill Expert (preview) are a long and a short descripions of the project

-- Bill Expert Presentation - well, obviously, a presentation, but there are only the key words on the slides, you can't understand it without reading the article
