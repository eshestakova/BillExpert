-- In jupyter notebook BillExpert_clear.ipynb everything is done and explained step by step for your comfort. :3 There is some data processing, some machine learning to predict the result and some Telegram-API stuff to make a bot.

-- BillExpert.ipynb contains the same code, but it isn't separated. It's easier to compile but more difficult to understand.

-- Excel file dosie.xls contains training data: names, authors, and result (if the law has passed or not).

-- In two .docx files Bill Expert (article) and Bill Expert (preview) are a long and a short descriptions of the project, respectively.

-- Bill Expert Presentation - a presentation (obviously), but there are only the keywords on the slides, you can't understand it without reading the article.
