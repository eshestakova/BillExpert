-- Excel file dosie.xls contains names, authors and result: was the law passed or not.
-- In jupyter notebook DocumentEnactmentPredictor.ipynb there are some data processing, some machine learning to predict result and some Telegram-API stuff to make a bot.
-- BillExpert.ipynb contains the same information, but it isn't separated. It's easier to compile, but more difficult to understand.
